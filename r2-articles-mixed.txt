                    The knee is one of the largest and most complex joints in the body
                    knee joins the thigh bone (femur) to the shin bone (tibia).
                    kneecap 
                    Ligaments join the knee bones and provide stability to the knee
                    The anterior cruciate ligament prevents the femur from sliding backward on      the tibia
                    The posterior cruciate ligament prevents the femur from sliding forward on      the tibia
                    The medial and lateral collateral ligaments prevent the femur from sliding side to side.
                    PCL (posterior cruciate ligament) strain or tear: PCL tears can cause pain,
                        swelling, and knee instability. These injuries are less common than ACL 
                        tears, and physical therapy (rather than surgery) is usually the best option
                    MCL (medial collateral ligament) strain or tear: This injury may cause pain and possible instability to the inner side of the knee.
                    Gout: A form of arthritis caused by buildup of uric acid crystals in a joint
                    Arthritis and Pseudogout
                    Knee osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, and often affects the knees. Caused by aging and wear and tear    of cartilage, osteoarthritis symptoms may include knee pain, stiffness, and swelling.
